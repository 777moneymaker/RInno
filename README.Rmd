RInno makes it easy to deploy local shiny apps by providing an interface between R and [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php), an installer for windows programs. It is designed to be simple to use (two lines of code at a minimum), yet comprehensive.

If your client does not have R installed, the RInno's installation wizard will ask them to install it.  It also provides a framework for managing R software packages required by your shiny apps and error logging features.

## Getting Started

```
# If you don't have development tools, install them
install.packages('devtools'); require(devtools)

# Use install_bitbucket to get RInno
devtools::install_bitbucket(
  repo            = 'fi_consulting/RInno',
  auth_user       = <username>,
  password        = <password>,
  build_vignettes = TRUE)

# Required Packages
require(RInno)
require(installr)
require(magrittr)
require(stringr)

# Use RInno to get Inno Setup
RInno::install_inno()
```

If you don't use [installr](https://github.com/talgalili/installr) to update your R version, you should. The next release of installr will include `install_inno` along with a lot of other cool stuff. After that release, `install_inno` will no longer be supported here.

## Minimal example

```
# Create an example app in your working directory
example_app(wd = getwd())

# Build a deployment
create_app(app_name = 'Your appname', app_dir = 'app')
compile_iss()
```

With simple apps, you should be able to build an installation wizard with `create_app` followed by `compile_iss`.

After you call `create_app`, there will be a lot of new files in your app's directory.  Feel free to customize them before you call `compile_iss`.  For example, you can replace the default/setup icon at [Flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com/), or you can customize the pre-install message in readme.txt. Just remember that the default values for those files have not changed. The .iss script will not know if you create a new icon called "myicon.ico". `compile_iss` will look for "default.ico", so you must replace it.

For custom installations, see below.


## server.R Requirements

In order to close the app when your user's session completes:

1. add `session` to your `server` function
2. call `stopApp()` when the session ends 

```
function(input, output, session) {

  session$onSessionEnded(function() {
      stopApp()
      q("no")
  })
}
```

## Custom Installation Wizards

If you would like create a custom installation wizard from within R, you can slowly build up to it with `create_app`, like this:

```
create_app(
  app_name  = 'My AppName', 
  app_dir    = 'My/app/path',
  dir_out   = 'wizard',
  pkgs      = c('jsonlite', 'shiny', 'magrittr', 'xkcd'),
  include_R = TRUE,   # Download R and install it with your app, if necessary
  R_version = 2.2.1,  # Old versions of R
  privilege = 'high', # Admin only installation
  default_dir = 'pf') # Program Files
```

`create_app` passes its arguments to other functions, so you can specify most things there or provide detailed instructions directly to those functions like this:

```
# Copy deployment scripts (JavaScript, icons, readme.txt, run.R, app.R)
copy_deployment(app_dir = 'my/app/path')

# If your users need R installed:
get_R_exe(
  app_dir    = 'my/app/path', 
  R_version = 2.2.1)

# Create batch file
create_bat(app_name = 'My AppName', app_dir = 'my/app/path')

# Create app config file
create_config(
  app_name = 'My AppName', 
  R_version = 2.2.1, 
  app_dir = 'my/app/path')

# Create package dependency list
create_pkgs(
  pkgs = c('jsonlite', 'shiny', 'magrittr', 'dplyr', 'caret', 'xkcd'), 
  app_dir = 'my/app/path')

# Build the iss script
start_iss(app_name = 'My AppName') %>%

  # C-like directives
  directives(R_version   = 2.2.1, 
             include_R   = TRUE, 
             app_version = '0.1.2',
             publisher   = 'Your Company', 
             main_url    = 'yourcompany.com') %>%

  # Setup Section
  setup(output_dir  = 'wizard', 
        app_version = 2.2.1,
        default_dir = 'pf', 
        privilege   = 'high',
        inst_readme = 'pre-install instructions.txt', 
        setup_icon  = 'myicon.ico',
        pub_url     = 'mycompany.com', 
        sup_url     = 'mycompany.github.com/issues',
        upd_url     = 'mycompany.github.com') %>%

  # Languages Section
  languages() %>%

  # Tasks Section
  tasks(desktop_icon = FALSE) %>%

  # Files Section
  files(app_dir = 'my/app/path', file_list = 'path/to/extra/files') %>%

  # Icons Section
  icons(app_desc       = 'This is my local shiny app',
        app_icon       = 'notdefault.ico',
        prog_menu_icon = FALSE,
        desktop_icon   = FALSE) %>%

  # Execution & Pascal code to check registry during installation
  # If the user has R, don't give them an extra copy
  # If the user needs R, give it to them
  run() %>%
  code() %>%

  # Write the Inno Setup script
  writeLines(file.path('my/app/path', 'My AppName.iss'))

  # Check your files, then
  compile_iss()

```

Feel free to read the Inno Setup [documentation](http://www.jrsoftware.org/ishelp/) and RInno's documentation to get a sense for what is possible. Please also suggest useful features or build them yourself!
